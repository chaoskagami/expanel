REQUIREMENTS ------------

 - imlib2
 - freetype2

 - gcc 4.x.x to compile library (tested on gcc 4.7.3 with pie and ssp enabled)

INSTALL -------

Simple build & install (as not root user and with sudo installed, or
simply run as root without sudo):

./configure && sudo make install

Will install expanel to /usr/bin/expanel and themes to
/usr/share/expanel/themes.  If you don't like default prefix for
install, you can specify it like this:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local && sudo make install

RUNNING -------

Simply run:

expanel [opts] <theme>

where <theme> is one of built-in themes or separate downloaded theme.

EXPanel doesn't use config files, it uses theme files instead. EXPanel
will search for themes in the following places in following order:

1. ~/.expanel/themes/<theme> 2. PREFIX/share/expanel/themes/<theme>
(default: /usr/share/expanel/themes/<theme>) 3. ./<theme>

You might want to run bmpanel in background. For example with native
theme:

bmpanel native &

THEME NOTES
-----------

Expanel uses fontconfig font searching style. For
more info please see: http://fontconfig.org/fontconfig-user.html

More documentation will come. Hopefully I'll format some manpages.
