EXPanel (Extended Panel) is a lightweight panel with taskbar, tray, desktop
switcher and clock (with more soon.) It's a fork of bmpanel which hasn't been maintained,
which itself is is a themeable reincarnation of fspanel. This panel should work with
any NETWM (aka EWMH) compliant window manager. The systray follows only the standard
systray-spec, KDE tray is not supported for the moment (the original author didn't
care apparently. 'non-standards can die' was his phrasing. I do care, however.)

Keep in mind this version is a fork. You probably (definitely) will get zero support
from the original author. Go to my github (github.com/chaoskagami/expanel) and report
bugs there. I'll need the version/git-rev you're running, as well as the versions of
software on the backend.

Note that bmpanel theme format will be deprecated soon. For now, it will accept them if
-b is passed on the console.

Thank you for using expanel!
