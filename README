EXPanel (Extended Panel) is a lightweight panel with taskbar, tray, desktop switcher and clock (with more soon.) It's a fork of bmpanel which hasn't been maintained, which itself is is a themeable reincarnation of fspanel. This panel should work with any NETWM (aka EWMH) compliant window manager. The systray follows only the standard systray-spec, KDE tray is not supported for the moment (the original author didn't care apparently. 'non-standards can die' was his phrasing. I do care, however, and it will make its way in. It does not seem to support MATE's tray, GNOME3's tray, etc. Bitrot, I know.)

Keep in mind this version is a fork. You probably (definitely) will get zero support from the original author. Go to my github (github.com/chaoskagami/expanel) and report bugs there. I'll need the version/git-rev you're running, as well as the versions of software on the backend.

Note that bmpanel theme format will be deprecated soon. For now, it will accept them if -b is passed on the console. For now (until the new theme format is done being implemented and stablized) it will automatically fall back to it.

Want to build? See INSTALL.
Legalese? See COPYING. TL;DR - MIT. On everything.
